## Recipe Box
 # Problem Statement:
Cooking professionals often struggle to organize and access their favorite recipes in one place.
They need a simple and user-friendly solution to store, manage, and share their recipes
conveniently.
# Solution:
I propose to build a Recipe Box application that allows users to create, store, and view their
favorite recipes. The Recipe Box will offer an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to add,
edit, and delete recipes. It will also include features to search for recipes .
 ## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
1. landing page-to introduce the recipe box and its features


2. User login-log in to access their personal recipe collection


3. Recipe details-user can view detailed information about a specific recipe


4. Recipe Creation Form-users can create a recipe by filling out the form


5. Recipe listing-all the user's recipes will be listed here


6. Recipe deletion-users can delete recipes that they no longer use


7. Search bar-allow users to search specific recipes


8. User-friendly interface- for smooth interaction by the user
